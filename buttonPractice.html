    <h1>Butterfingers: The Tale of a Young Squire</h1>   
        <p>This tale is about a squire whose name is Scott.  Now, Scott qualifies for being a knight.  He is witty, courageous, and persevering; however, he has an affliction that still had him be a squire;  he has butterfingers.  For seven years, it seemed that Scott simply couldn’t overcome this curse that blocked his path to knighthood.  Lucky for him, he had a patient teacher, one who was the most valiant of the land, Sir Ivan.  When most of the knights turned Scott down because of his butterfingers, Sir Ivan was there, welcoming Scott as his squire.  When the other knights heard this, they were a bit confused, but they didn’t question Ivan’s decision.</p>
